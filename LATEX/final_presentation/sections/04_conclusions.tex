\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A model that has a better CI than the previous state-of-the-art values has been created.
    \item The model did not use a CNN
    \item By using CC clusters it was possible to validate the scalar model
    \item Some time was spent learning how DNNs and CNNs work
    \item Two important innovations from the previous results:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Converting the regression survival problem into a classification one by using 
      the siamese network
      \item Using a DNN to train the survival data
    \end{itemize}
    \item The initial objectives seem complete
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When working with the deep residual siamese and using CNN there's still 
    room for improvement. This model was built and tested but a proper 
    hyper-parameter search may get better results, future work will be directed towards
    finding a good set of hyper-parameters that can help the model to converge.
    \item Improvements towards using CNN for the model can also be focused in 
    using transfer learning once 3D pre-trained CNN models start to appear.
    \item Even though the CI has been improved, future work should also be focused in 
    using the results to predict a patient's survival time or risk.
    \item The found model should also be validated by using more data or an external dataset.
  \end{itemize}
