\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Some time was spent learning how DNNs and CNNs work
    \item A model that has a better CI than the previous state-of-the-art values has been created,
    although it did not use a CNN
    \item By using Compute Canada clusters it was possible to validate the scalar model
    \item Two important innovations from the previous results:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Converting the regression survival problem into a classification one by using 
      the siamese network
      \item Using a DNN to train the survival data
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find better hyper-parameters when using a CNN
    \item Use transfer learning with CNNs.
    \item Predict a patient's survival time or risk
    \item Validate model through external dataset
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
