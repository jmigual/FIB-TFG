\ssecc{Preprocess data}

As it was previously stated the data needs to be preprocessed before start training with it.
This steps are required because small changes can really help in reducing the time needed to
fit the model. By normalizing the data and setting variance to 1 and mean to 0 the training time
can be reduced in many epochs.

% TODO: Insert paper about batch normalization.

\sssecc{Image data}

The imaging data in the \Gls{PMHNK} contains 671 folders, each one with the scan of one patient. 
We also have the clinical information of 661 patients, although we do not have a \gls{CT} for
each of the clinical information patients. Through the intersection of each of the two data
sources we have 544 patients with both a \gls{CT} scan and the clinical information.

However, because there was a problem in the way the \gls{CT} scan was computed we only have
the tumour annotations for 509 of the 544 patients, so the data that we can use is reduced
again. \textbf{509} will be the final dataset size that will be used for the next 
steps.
