\section{Budget and sustainability}

\subsection{Project budget}

In order to carry out this project some resources will be needed. In this document, 
an estimation of the cost of the project is presented, keeping in mind the required
hardware and software resources, and its corresponding amortizations. Also, the
indirect costs of the project are counted too.

\subsubsection{Hardware budget}

In order to implement the different models, previously explained. Some hardware will be
needed. The training will usually be done in Compute Canada computing platform. the
access to the different provided clusters it's provided by the Bioinformatics and 
Computational Genomics Laboratory.
