\section{Project Planning}

\subsection{Planning and scheduling}

The estimated project duration is of about 4 months. The project starts on Wednesday 14th of 
February, 2018 and the deadline is on Wednesday 20th June, 2018, the day before leaving the 
Benjamin Haibe-Kains Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Laboratory.

It must be noticed that the initial planning can be revised and updated as a result of the 
project's evolution and feedback received from the lab members. 

\subsection{Task description}

\subsubsection{Acquire background in Convolutional Neural Networks}

The first step is to acquire a better understanding in how a convolutional neural network works
so in the las month I've been learning about Convolutional Neural Networks. I started with 
basic statistics applied to \emph{Machine Learning} with the book \emph{The Elements of 
Statistical Learning}.~\cite{ElementsStatisticalLearning}

Then I continued by doing three courses made by \href{https://www.deeplearning.ai}{Deeplearning.ai}
and published at Coursera~\cite{Coursera} related to Convolutional Neural Networks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning}{Neural Networks and 
        Deep Learning}~\cite{Coursera:NN}
    \item \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network}{Improving Deep Neural Networks: 
    Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization}~\cite{Coursera:NNHyperparameters}
    \item \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks}{Convolutional Neural 
        Networks}~\cite{Coursera:CNN}
\end{itemize}
