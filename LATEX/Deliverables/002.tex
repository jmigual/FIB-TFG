\section{Project Planning}

\subsection{Planning and scheduling}

The estimated project duration is of about 4 months. The project starts on Wednesday 14th of 
February, 2018 and the deadline is on Wednesday 20th June, 2018, the day before leaving the 
Benjamin Haibe-Kains Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Laboratory.

It must be noticed that the initial planning can be revised and updated as a result of the 
project's evolution and feedback received from the lab members. 

\subsection{Task description}

\subsubsection{Acquire background in Convolutional Neural Networks}

In the last month I have been learning in deep and convolutional neural networks in particular. 
I started with basic statistics using the book \emph{The Elements of Statistical Learning}
~\cite{ElementsStatisticalLearning}.
